It's weaker than the Air Cannon, but works on water and can fire three times consecutively. He also can fire it while running.\nThe Ataru Gun is listed under number 01 out of 61 gadgets in the game.\nIn this game this gadget, along with all other gadgets in Doraemon's pocket except a couple, is covered with slime and can't be used unless the player collects 5 Sprays to clean the slime. Then it can be used by any character.\nIt works just like in the Manga, it locks on the enemies and inflicts moderate damage.\nIn this game, the gadget is unlocked when Nobita and Doraemon enters a water puddle while minimised, and Air Cannon or Umatake doesn't work in water. Doraemon takes out the gadget so Nobita can clear out the enemies. It still can lock on enemies.\nUnlike Nobita no Machi SOS, this gadget is locked to Nobita in this game, so Doraemon is unable to use it.",
