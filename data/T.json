    "description": "The Take-copter is a small yellow colored gadget consisting of horizontally spinning rooters guided by a thin shaft which connects to a wide base. It can easily fit into a normal pocket present in pants or trousers. Sometimes, it consists of a button at the back or on top.\nIn 1973 anime, the Take-copter had a wider and conical base and the middle part seemed like an antennae.\nIn 1979 anime and 2005 anime, it had a semi spherical base and was smaller than the 1973 one.\nIn Stand by Me Doraemon, it had a brown colored suction cap at the base.\nDorami's Take-copter is generally pink colored.\nMini-Doras' Take-copters look exactly same as Doraemon's but they are very small on the basis of size.\n\n\n\n\nThe Take-copter is one of the action gadgets of Doraemon. It allows him to fly around. It uses battery, which recharges when not being used. When it's battery runs out, Doraemon descends slowly yet rather uncontrollably. A player may spam the Y button so that Doraemon may get flight and descends further forward. Unlike in the TV shows, Doraemon cannot use other gadgets whilst flying using the Take-copter and neither he can transform into Nobita, but the player can still summon assist other characters.\nIt is listed under number 32 out of 61 gadgets in the game.\nThe Take-copter is a gadget which changes all of the dice's surfaces to 6 dots.\nThe Take-copter also appears in this game.\nThe Take-copter also appears in this game.\nThe name \"Take-copter\" combines the words take tombo (bamboo dragonfly, the Japanese name for bamboo-copter), and herikoputa, meaning helicopter. It was also used to be called \"heri-tombo\".\nIts Japanese name \"Take-copter\" (タケコプター) is a portmanteau of タケ' [Translation - \"Take\"] (Bamboo) and コプター [Translation - \"Herikoputaa\"] (Helicopter).\nIts English name \"Hopter\" is a portmanteau of Hop and Copter.",

    "description": "Time Machine is a gadget of 22nd Century which is used to do time travel.\nThe Time Machine consists of a computer operator and a panel consisting of few handles and switches. It has minimum one seat for the driver to sit. It also consists of an antennae like projection(s) which collects signals.\nDoraemon's Time Machine is the most commonly seen and used time machine in the franchise. It consists of a nearly-square-shaped chassis, with various appliances mounting on it, such as controls, antennae, etc. The machine is magnetically powered. It originally has the capacity to hold up to three people at maximum. But since it had broken down once, Doraemon upgraded the gadget, and it is now able to transport up to five people. It is placed in the upper drawer of Nobita's desk in Nobita's room in Nobi's Residence. In the 1973 anime, Doraemon's Time Machine had two seats like a car's interior and two levers. It was fully purple coloured. The antennae didn't exist.\nPawaemon's Time Machine can be seen in Battle! Cat-Model Robots vs. Dog-Model Robots. The overall appearance of his Time Machine remains the same as Doraemon's except it has different colors.\nDorami's Time Machine is more advanced as compared to Doraemon's. It is more spacious and comfortable from inside. It is an orange (sometimes red) tulip-shaped machine with its leaf-like base. Furthermore, it has three antennae like projections at the top which seems to appear like the pistil of a flower. Dorami's time machine is placed in the mirror of her room.\nThe thief's Time Machine which appeared as A Visitor from the Country of the Future was black coloured, having a pair of yellow and red lights front and back.\nTime Patrol's Time Machines resembles like a police car having black and white colour with a small red tail like bulb which glows at the top. They are shaped like a computer mouse. The word \"Police\" is written on it's on both sides.\nIn Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur, Black Mask's Time Machine was flat and had his face on it. It had an antenna and a chair. His time hole was rectangular shaped. In Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur 2006, his Time Machine was highly advanced and was more comfortable with fewer controls. It was big and wide and was designed like a king's seat. His time hope was hexagonal.",
