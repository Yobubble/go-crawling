The sound it made are like normal horse footsteps.\nThe Uma-Take is Nobita's first gadget in the game. It allows his to move very fast but in a jumping motion. When using it to jump, pressing the Y button(get off the Uma-Take) will make Nobita jumps, enabling him to reach higher places.\nThe Uma-Take can be used to crush enemies like the Stone Lion and Robo-Mouse by jumping on them. Some enemies cannot be damaged by the Uma-Take, causing Nobita to receive damage instead. The Uma-Take cannot be used underwater.\nThe Uma-Take is listed under number 4 out of 61 gadgets in the game.",
