They always tell them the best thing to do, with the doll itself have the power to predict the future. Although its guidance always saves the wearer from danger or trouble, the doll can be a 'control freak'. For example, the good guidance it can give is when how to swing or to let the ball pass when Nobita is playing baseball. The other example is the bad guidance that tells Nobita to study instead of helping Doraemon find his lost screw.\nThe Guidance Angel is a good consultant, but it is a control freak. Because it can predict the future, it is often very snobbish about its knowledge. Its opinions are very selfish, only cares about the person's well being (in terms of success in life) instead of their morality.\nThe Guidance Angel is one of the \"Aids (たすける) Gadgets\" in the game. It cost only 1 Bell Point, the cheapest to use amongst the other. It shows the proper path for the player by pointing out the way. When an item is spotted, it will fly towards it, prompting the player to pick them up. If the player is ignoring it and/or going the other way around, the Guidance Angel will start hitting either Doraemon or Nobita angrily. Note that it does not deal damage to either Nobita or Doraemon.\nUnlike in the series, the Guidance Angel in this game flies around, and only actives for a while.\nThe Guidance Angel is listed under number 55 out of 61 gadgets in the game.",
