While if one person wears the N Crest while the other wears the S Crest, they'll be attracted to each other. Simply put, the Crest itself cause the person to become a magnetic pole themselves (theoretically speaking).",

    "description": "The Nature Plastic Model Series (Nature Observation Plastic Model Series) are a series of gadgets that are used for natural observations. Animals that can lay eggs, such as birds and fish, are the types of plastic models available. Four such plastic models are featured in the episode of the same name.\nEach plastic model comes with a pedestal and two halves of an egg shell. One has to set up the pedestal and place the egg shell on the pedestal for the growth process to occur. Once the plastic model reaches its end of the growth process, it disappears back to the two halves of the egg shell.\nAlternatively, the user can choose to let the plastic model remain at any stage of the growth process by using a Stop Spray on the plastic model. This way, the plastic model will not disappear into the half-eggs and remain at that stage.",
