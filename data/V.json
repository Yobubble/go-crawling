For say, if the person shouted 'Ya!', a corresponding Katakana letter 'Ya' (ヤ) will come out. Meanwhile, İf user shouts 'Ro' it will became an object shaped like \"ロ\". The letter's velocity is slightly slower than sound, and it does bounce off or be absorbed into hard surfaces and soft surfaces respectively (because their properties is rather similar to sound). The letters can maintain their velocity and momentum for a surprising amount of time and so may serve as transportation on their own.",
